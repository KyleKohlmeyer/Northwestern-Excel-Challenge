# Northwestern-Excel-Challenge

## This repository is the analysis of a crowdfunding dataset in excel. 
The Excel file in this repository includes all the crowdfunding data, as well as the formatting, graphs, and tables necessary to analyze the data. The conclusions for the analysis can be found below in this ReadMe, as well as in the written responses file. 

## Conclusions
One of the main conclusions that can be drawn from the data is that theater productions are the most commonly crowd funded, having both the most successes and failures. The sub-category plays accounts for all the crowdfunding projects within this category. 
Interestingly, over half of all projects funded were successful, with most categories having more successes than failures, demonstrating that crowdfunding for entertainment is a viable option for producers of all categories. 
There is a slight uptick in the number of successful crowdfunding campaigns in June and July. However, the failure amount remains nearly constant. Thus, the slight uptick of successes in the summer months is likely mainly due to there being slightly more campaigns in those months, with a marginal increase in success odds for that time of year. 

A major limitation of the dataset is that most of the data is collected from the United States compared to other countries. There just is not enough data to draw solid conclusions for other countries. If good conclusions are to be made for countries that are not the United States, then more data must be collected. 
Additionally, outside of category and time of year, there is not a lot of information included about the projects. How were the goal amounts determined? Are different categories more expensive to produce and thus need different goal amounts?  Perhaps knowing more information about this could help draw conclusions on what the optimal crowdfunding goal should be for a project in a given category or subcategory.  

One shortcoming of the analysis is that failure and success are considered binary in the analysis performed. If a project was a dollar away from reaching the goal or $5000 away, it was treated the same, even if this is very different outcome in practice. The main table and graph I would create would be a pivot table with information about how much a campaign exceeded its goal or failed to meet it. This would provide information about how realistic each goal was and give managers of failed campaigns information to alter their donation expectations to succeed, given that a lot of crowdfunding websites do not give out any money for partially successful campaigns. The amount of money raised relative to the goal could also be used to predict future success when the project is released, as exceeding the goal likely correlates with high interest. I would also make a pivot table and chart based on campaign length so that conclusions could be drawn on whether there is an optimal campaign length overall and for each category/sub-category. 

The median is more useful than the mean because the data is skewed right from campaigns that have a large amount of backers. The median is much more representative of the entire dataset.
